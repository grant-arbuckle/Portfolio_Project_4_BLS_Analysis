# Portfolio_Project_4_BLS_Analysis
### This project invovled a walk through a full ETL data pipeline: pulling raw data through an API with Python, parsing the API response and transforming the data with Power Query, and loading and visualizing the data in PowerBI dashboards.
### The "BLS Analysis.pdf" file shows what the completed dashboard looks like. The "script_for_powerbi" files contain the formatted versions of the Jupyter notebooks I used to make API calls and bring back data directly in PowerBI.
