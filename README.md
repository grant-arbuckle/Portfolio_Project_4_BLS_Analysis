# Portfolio_Project_4_BLS_Analysis
### This project invovled a walk through a full ETL data pipeline: pulling raw data through an API with Python, parsing the API response and transforming the data with Power Query, and loading and visualizing the data in PowerBI dashboards.
### The "BLS Analysis.pdf" file shows what the completed dashboard looks like. The "API_call_BLS.ipynb" files are the Jupyter Notebooks I used to parse the JSON responses I received from the API and prep them for PowerBI ingestion. The "script_for_powerbi" files contain the formatted versions of the Jupyter notebooks I used to make API calls and bring back data directly in PowerBI.
### Business questions I sought to answer through this analysis:
#### 1. How has the average CPI changed over the past 3 years?
#### 2. Which common products increased in price the most over the past year? (Top 5)
#### 3. How has the unemployment rate changed over the past 12 months? 10 years?
#### 4. Have the average hourly earnings increased proportionally to the CPI?
#### 5. Is there a relationship between the unemployment rate and CPI?
